          <p class="pt-2">In my dissertation, I investigate how great powers respond to the emergence of power vacuums, which I conceptualize as instances of international authority collapse such as occur during great power retrenchment and collapse. I am primarily interested in answering the following questions: why do great powers seek to assert authority in some power vacuums but not others? And what determines their choice of strategy when they decide to compete for it? Specifically, when do they launch military interventions to directly assert authority in a power vacuum, and when do they seek to assert authority only indirectly by providing military and economic aid to favored political actors on the ground? My central argument is that great powers compete for authority over power vacuums when they fear an adversary could assert control over the respective space and thus shift the geopolitical balance of power, which is a function of material resources and geographic location, in its favor. Which strategy a great power employs towards a power vacuum in which it has a strategic interest primarily depends on the interaction of two factors: first, whether a genuinely vital interest or only an important interest is at stake; and second, whether the collapse of international authority coincides with the collapse of national authority structures in the respective political space. While the former influences a great power’s cost and risk acceptance, the latter is relevant insofar as a strong state authority which the population recognizes as its legitimate ruler can tap into nationalistic sentiment and effectively organize a defense effort against outside intervention.

          <p class="py-1">Following the first two chapters in which I introduce my conceptualization of power vacuums and develop my theoretical argument, the three subsequent chapters provide in-depth case studies of how the United States responded to several crucial episodes of international authority collapse, including the defeat and decline of Germany and Japan in World War II as well as the end of the British Empire in the Middle East. Grounded in an extensive study of the primary and secondary record, process tracing analyses find strong support for my theory in these cases, with decisionmakers largely basing their foreign policy choices on precisely the factors I argue to dominate their power vacuum calculus. Lastly, in order to corroborate the external validity of my findings, a final empirical chapter presents the results of a large-N qualitative analysis (LNQA), i.e., qualitative assessments of every single case of a power vacuum emerging in the time period 1945–1989. The LNQA chapter demonstrates that my theory performs well in the large majority of Cold War cases while also uncovering the reasons for why it falls short in a few others.

	  <p class="py-1">The project directly contributes to the burgeoning research program on hierarchy in international politics. While existing research on hierarchy in IR has largely focused on why and how hierarchical relationships between great powers and other actors emerge and dissolve, my work focuses on the consequences, not causes, of their dissolution. It thereby illuminates the international consequences of great power decline and retrenchment, which are the subject of much debate in the current academic and policy discourse on U.S. grand strategy – particularly in the context of China’s continued rise and fears of U.S. decline abroad, as evidenced by discussions surrounding the recent withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
