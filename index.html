<h1>Moritz S. Graefrath</h1>

<p>
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame. I specialize in International Relations.
</p>
<p>
Broadly speaking, my research interests include international relations theory, great power politics, and international security.  Currently, I investigate the role of intentions in international politics, sovereign debt as a foreign policy instrument, and statesâ€™ use of international conflict settlement venues.
</p>
<p>
Prior to coming to Notre Dame, I received a B.A. in Philosophy & Economics from the University of Bayreuth, Germany. I have also studied at Washington & Lee University (Lexington, VA) as an exchange student.
